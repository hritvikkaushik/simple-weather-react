# simple-weather-react

A simple weather app created using react that allows user to search for their location, shows search suggestions and displays current weather data, as well as forecast of next 5 days, for the location selected by user.

## APIs used

The project uses following APIs:
- MapBox for place search and geocoding
- OpenWeatherMap for weather data

## How to use

The app is simple to use. On initialisation, there will be no output as no location is selected.

- Simply go to the search box on the top of the app, start typing.
- After 3 characters have been entered, search suggestions will pop up.
- Keep typing until the desired location appears in the results, then click on the suggestion.
- The search suggestions will close and the weather data will be updated.

## TODO

- Implement error handling.
- Implement dynamic styling based on time of day and outlook.
- Convert application into a responsive one, accessible to various display sizes.
